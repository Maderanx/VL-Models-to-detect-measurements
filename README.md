# Extracting Product Measurements from Images Using Vision-Language Models: Paligemma, BLIP-2, LLaVA, and Moondream2

As Vision-Language Models continue to evolve, they have expanded their use cases into new territories. One such use case is **automated extraction of measurements** (such as height, width, weight, etc.) from product images. This capability has the potential to transform industries like **e-commerce**, **warehousing**, and **quality control**, where large-scale data handling and accuracy are paramount. 

In this repository, we explore the application of various  models like **Paligemma**, **BLIP-2**, **LLaVA**, and **Moondream2** to extract precise measurements from product images. Finally, after detailed comparisons, we adopt **Moondream2** as the most efficient model due to its lightweight architecture.

## Introduction to Vision-Language Models

Vision-Language Models  are a type of AI architecture designed to process both visual data (images) and text-based data simultaneously. These models enable tasks like:
- Image captioning
- Visual question answering (VQA)
- Image classification
- Measurement extraction from product images

Each of the models we explored—Paligemma, BLIP-2, LLaVA, and Moondream2—has unique strengths in understanding and generating language from images. Let’s dive into each model.

## Paligemma

### Overview
**Paligemma** is one of the most powerful Vision-Language models available today for extracting fine-grained details from images. The model integrates robust **natural language understanding (NLU)** and **visual feature extraction**, allowing it to generate precise outputs. It has been particularly effective for tasks involving **detailed measurements** like height, width, and volume from product images.

### Strengths
- **Highly accurate for measurement extraction**: Paligemma is exceptional when it comes to precision, especially in scenarios where the product measurements need to be as accurate as possible.
- **Fine-grained data processing**: The model is trained on tasks that require capturing minute details in the image.

### Weaknesses
- **Resource-intensive**: It requires a significant amount of computational power, making it slower and more costly to run for large-scale datasets.
- **Slower inference**: Due to the complexity of the architecture, Paligemma may not be ideal for real-time applications.

### Best Use Case
Paligemma is well-suited for tasks that require the **highest level of precision**, such as extracting dimensions for engineering products or where compliance with exact size guidelines is critical.

## BLIP-2

### Overview
**BLIP-2** is designed for a broad range of multimodal applications, including image captioning and **visual question answering (VQA)**. While BLIP-2 handles general queries about an image, it can be adapted to measure objects based on the context provided. It excels at providing **descriptive responses** to open-ended questions like "What is the height of this product?"

### Strengths
- **Multimodal robustness**: BLIP-2 excels at understanding and answering natural language queries about images.
- **Versatility**: It can handle a variety of tasks beyond measurements, making it a multi-functional model.

### Weaknesses
- **Overkill for simple measurement tasks**: While highly versatile, BLIP-2 can be overly complex and slow for tasks that only require basic measurements.
- **Inference speed**: It tends to be slower due to its general-purpose design.

### Best Use Case
BLIP-2 is ideal when dealing with **multi-modal scenarios** that require more than just measurements, such as e-commerce platforms that need product descriptions along with dimensional data.

## LLaVA

### Overview
**LLaVA** (Language Learning from Vision and Audio) is known for its **high-speed querying** and efficient processing of visual data. It allows users to ask questions about an image, and it will generate responses quickly. LLaVA excels in interactive applications, where users need to query an image about its dimensions or features.

### Strengths
- **Fast**: Compared to models like Paligemma and BLIP-2, LLaVA is more lightweight and performs better in real-time scenarios.
- **Efficient query answering**: Ideal for applications where users need quick answers about images.

### Weaknesses
- **Limited precision**: While fast, LLaVA struggles with extremely fine measurements, especially in more detailed product images.
- **Not as powerful for intricate tasks**: LLaVA might not capture the level of detail required for very fine-grained measurement extraction.

### Best Use Case
LLaVA is perfect for **interactive applications** where users need to ask multiple queries about an image’s content, but it is less suited for high-precision measurement extraction.

## Moondream2

### Overview
**Moondream2** is a **transformer-based architecture** that is optimized for both **visual question answering** (VQA) and **measurement extraction** tasks. Unlike the heavier models like Paligemma or BLIP-2, Moondream2 offers a **lightweight, fast, and flexible** solution that still performs well in extracting structured data like dimensions from images.

### Strengths
- **Lightweight and fast**: Moondream2 is much faster and more efficient than Paligemma and BLIP-2.
- **High flexibility**: It can be fine-tuned for various tasks, making it a versatile tool for measurement extraction.
- **Good balance between accuracy and performance**: Although not as precise as Paligemma, it provides reliable results with significantly better inference times.

### Weaknesses
- **Lower precision**: In cases where extreme accuracy is needed, such as for manufacturing purposes, it may fall short compared to Paligemma.

### Best Use Case
Moondream2 shines in **general-purpose measurement extraction**, especially when processing speed and resource constraints are more critical than extreme accuracy. It’s ideal for large-scale product catalogues where dimensions must be extracted quickly and reliably.

## Why We Use Moondream2

After experimenting with all the models, we decided to use **Moondream2** for the following reasons:

1. **Lightweight Architecture**: Unlike Paligemma and BLIP-2, which are computationally intensive, Moondream2 offers a more balanced approach. It runs efficiently on smaller hardware setups while providing reasonably accurate measurement outputs.
   
2. **Speed**: In real-time applications or bulk image processing (e.g., in an e-commerce setting), speed is a crucial factor. Moondream2’s fast inference times make it an ideal candidate for such environments.

3. **Flexibility**: While Paligemma is specialized for fine-grained details, Moondream2 offers the flexibility to handle various tasks. We found it suitable for general measurement extraction tasks where extreme precision is not required.

## Implementation Steps

To use Moondream2 for extracting measurements from product images:

### Step 1: Data Preprocessing
Ensure that your product images are properly formatted and annotated. Resize, normalize, and preprocess the images to ensure consistency.

### Step 2: Load Moondream2
```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, BlipProcessor

# Load the processor and model
processor = BlipProcessor.from_pretrained("blip2")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("vikhyatk/moondream2")

# Preprocess and load image
from PIL import Image
image = Image.open("path_to_image.jpg")
inputs = processor(images=image, return_tensors="pt")
